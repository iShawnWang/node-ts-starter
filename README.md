# node-ts-starter
TypeScript Node Boilerplate with nodemon & ts-node

# Background
There isn't a `create-node-app-typescript` for us.
When a idea came to me, i need to setup a node.js playground with TypeScript and debugger support.
This repo is made for seamless debug with node and ts in VSCode and save one's life

# Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/iShawnWang/node-ts-starter`
2. `yarn`

# Usage
1. `npm run start`: auto watch change and restart
2. `npm run debug:start`: auto attach debugger and watch change
  - VSCode will auto attach and hang at breakpoint
