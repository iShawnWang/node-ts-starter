# node-ts-starter

TypeScript Node Boilerplate with tsx

# Background

There isn't a `create-node-app-typescript` for us.
When a idea came to me, i need to setup a node.js playground with TypeScript and debugger support.
This repo is made for seamless debug with node and ts in VSCode and save time.

# Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/iShawnWang/node-ts-starter`
2. `npm install`

# Usage

1. `npm run start`: auto watch change and restart
2. `npm run debug:start`: auto attach debugger and watch change

- VSCode will auto attach and hang at breakpoint
